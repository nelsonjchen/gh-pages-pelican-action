# GitHub Pages Pelican Build Action

This action builds a Pelican project and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

Please ensure a `requirements.txt` is present for your site and installs
`pelican` and other requirements needed to build your site.

A `requirements.txt` can be generated by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
in the virtual environment your pelican site is developed in.

## Environment variables

  - `GH_PAGES_BRANCH` (optional): override the default `gh-pages` deployment branch
  - `PELICAN_CONFIG_FILE` (optional): override the default `pelicanconf.py` config file        
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: (required) should be `${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}`, see [the workflow demo in the demo repository for an example of this][workflow_demo].

## History

Extracted from https://github.com/desertpy/desertpy-pelican.

It is not used there anymore though. For most sites though, this should
suffice.
